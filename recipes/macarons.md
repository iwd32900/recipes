# Macarons

Recipe from Les Secrets Gourmands de Noemie, as taught to us in Paris, summer 2022.

In a small bowl, whisk together:
- white of 3 large eggs, to make at least 100 g

In a perfect world, refrigerate the whites for 24 hours before continuing.

In a medium bowl, sift together using a coarse-mesh sifter:
- 150 g super-fine almond flour, such as Bob's Red Mill
- 150 g powdered sugar

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk, combine:
- 50 g egg whites
- 15 g (1 T) granulated sugar

Whisk at low speed until very foamy, with many small bubbles.
Then increase speed to until very soft peaks form.

Meanwhile, bring to a boil:
- 150 g granulated sugar
- 50 g water

Bring syrup to 234 F or 112 C.
Pour syrup into whipped egg whites with mixer running at low speed.
Whisk at high speed until the Italian meringue is thick, shiny, and cool to the touch.

Add:
- gel food coloring, as desired
- 50 g egg whites

Whisk just until combined.
Switch to the paddle attachment, and mix in the almond/sugar mixture.
The batter will thin slightly the longer it is beaten;
it should be thin enough that ribbons of batter smooth out within 5-10 seconds.
This will ensure the macarons have a smooth top after piping.

Prepare two cookie sheets with parchment paper, optionally marking 3 cm circles in pencil.
Place batter into a piping bag and snip off the tip.
Pipe with the bag held vertically just above the parchment, letting batter flow outward to make 3 cm circles.
Cookies will not expand noticeably, so if packed tightly they should all fit on 2 sheets.

Set the sheets aside to rest while the oven heats.  This allows the cookies to form a slight skin.
Heat the oven to convection 300 F (150 C).
Bake the macarons for about 12 minutes, until they are mostly solid but barely wiggle when pushed with a finger.

# Lemon cream filling

In a metal bowl, combine:
- 1/2 t powdered gelatine, such as Knox
- 70 g granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- zest of one lemon
- juice of one lemon, about 3 T

Mixing the gelatine into the sugar will keep it from clumping as it hydrates.
Whisk over a double boiler until the curd thickens.  Remove from heat.

Whisk in
- 80 g unsalted butter

Press plastic wrap over the curd.
Place in the freezer for 60 minutes to thicken.

Pipe lemon cream on the bottom surface of one macaron, then sandwich with a second.
Store in the refrigerator -- they need at least a few hours to reach the ideal texture.
