# Faux Poke

Inspired by the Hawaiian raw fish dish of poke.

In a nonreactive bowl, combine:

- 12 oz fake lobster, fake crab, or cooked shrimp
- one bunch green onions, white and green parts sliced thin
- one large avocado (6 oz), cubed and optionally tossed in the juice of half a lime
- half of a large hothouse cucumber (6 oz), sliced thin
- 2 oz carrots cut in matchsticks

Dress with:

- 3 T soy sauce
- 1.5 t sesame oil
- sriracha to taste
- 1/2 t wasabi powder, if desired

Other good vegetables include red or yellow pepper, and radishes.
One could substitute additional avocados for the fish to make this vegan.
Serve cold, over warm sushi rice.

# Sushi rice

Boil until water is absorbed, about 20 minutes:

- 1.5 c short- or medium-grain sushi rice
- 15 oz water

Dress with:

- 3 T rice vinegar
- 2 T sugar
- 2 t salt

If substituting brown or black rice, consider reducing the dressing,
since it isn't absorbed as well as hence comes through more aggressively.
