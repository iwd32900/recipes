# Taco Bake

Adapted from my mother's recipe.

For the biscuit crust:

- 7.25 oz self-rising flour
- 3 T cold butter, cut in thin slices
- 5 oz milk

Crumble butter into flour, stir in milk to make a wet dough.
Press into the bottom of a greased 9x9 pan.

For the ground beef filling:

- 1 lb ground beef, or 12 oz veggie crumbles
- 2 T minced onion (optional)
- 1 packet taco seasoning
- 14 oz can of tomatoes, drained and pureed in blender

Brown beef and onions.  Mix in seasonings and tomatoes.
No extra water should be needed.
Layer beef mixture over dough.

For the dairy topping:

- 2.5 oz (1/3 c) mayo
- 4 oz (1/2 c) sour cream
- 2 oz (1/2 c) shredded Cheddar

Mix together and spread on top of beef.
Sprinkle with paprika if desired.
Bake at 375 F for 25-30 minutes.
