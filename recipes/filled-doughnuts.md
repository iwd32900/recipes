# Filled doughnuts (paczki)

Use one recipe of the [Beautiful Buns tangzhong yeast dough](beautiful-buns.md).
Using the tangzhong technique ensures the doughnuts are fluffy and don't get hard.

After the first rise, divide the dough into 12 pieces.
Roll into balls and then flatten into disks, dusting with flour as needed.
Place in a greased 9 x 13 pan, with disks just touching each other.
Spray dough with oil, cover tightly, and refrigerate overnight.

In the morning, remove the pan and allow dough to rise while you prep some fillings.

Heat oil to 350 F.
Cook about 3 at a time, allowing them to become golden brown on one side before flipping.

When done, allow to drain for a few seconds, before tossing in granulated (or roasted) sugar.
Set aside to cool.

To fill, place filling in a large ziplock fitted with a piping tip coupler.
If your filling is smooth enough, also use a metal piping tip with a large opening.

Use a chopstick to poke a hole in the doughnut.
Sweep side to side to make a pocket inside.

Insert the pastry tip, then stand the doughnut on its side (hole up) and squeeze in filling.
You should see the doughnut swell slightly.

# Fillings

We have only begun to experiment with fillings.
They're so good you could easily eat

## Instant chocolate pudding

Quick, easy, and very popular with the kids.
One small box will fill at least 6 doughnuts, and possibly up to 12.

## Blueberry filling

Cook together until very thick and bubbling:

* 1 lb blueberries (I used frozen)
* 7 oz sugar (1 c)
* 2 T cornstarch

Off the heat, stir in:

* zest and juice of one clementine
* pinch of salt

One batch will fill at least 6 doughnuts, and possibly up to 12.
