# Ranch salad dressing

- 4 oz buttermilk
- 2 oz mayonnaise (light is OK)
- 1/2 t table salt
- 1/2 t garlic powder
- 1/4 t onion powder
- 1/2 t dried dill
- 1 t dried parsley

This is a quick and easy dressing that tastes better than the shelf-stable stuff.
When made with light mayo, it's also quite low calorie (32 cal for 2 T).
