- 9.5 oz (2 c) King Arthur all-purpose or bread flour
- 1 oz granulated sugar
- 2 t instant yeast
- 1 t salt
- 6 oz milk, microwaved 30 sec to warm

Roll out dough to the width of a stick of butter, and twice the length.
Cover and let rest to activate the yeast.

- 8 T unsalted butter (1 sticks)

Cut one stick lengthwise into four planks.
Wrap in parchment and microwave 15 seconds to soften.
Roll into a solid square, and refrigerate.

Place butter in the center of the dough.
Pull the sides up and join in the center to enclose the butter block.
Wrap in plastic and place in freezer for exactly 30 minutes to stiffen the dough texture to match the butter.

Repeat the following steps three times:
Roll the dough out until its length is three times its width.
Fold in thirds, like a letter.
Give the dough a quarter turn.
If the gluten becomes too tight to roll out, let rest 30+ minutes in the fridge.

Refrigerate dough at least 2 hours to thoroughly chill and to allow gluten to relax.
Roll out into a large rectangle.
Use pizza wheel to trim edges.  (Important -- these are tough and will block a good rise!)
Cut into 8 rectangles for filled croissants, or 8 triangles for standard.

- 1 oz chocolate chips for *pain au chocolat*, wrapped in a rectangle of dough.

Roll up and place seam-side down on parchment-lined baking sheet; cover in plastic.
Let rise 2-3 hours at room temperatures.
Either bake immediately, or hold up to 24 hours in the fridge.
(After 48 hours in the fridge, the dough looked wrinkled.)

- egg wash (1 large egg beaten with a pinch of salt)

Brush risen rolls with egg wash.
Bake 15-20 minutes at convection 350 F (or conventional 375 in a pinch).
The lower temperature allows good browning and rapid cooking without burning the butter.
