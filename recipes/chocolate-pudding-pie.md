# Meringue and chocolate pudding pie

I modified this from my sister-in-law's pie, which she labeled "Jean Green Chocolate Pie".

Blind bake a standard pie crust:  20 minutes with pie weights, followed by 15 minutes without, at 375 F.

In a large sauce pan, melt butter over low heat, then whisk in:

- 1 stick (1/2 c) butter, melted
- 4 egg yolks (whites reserved)

Next whisk in dry ingredients to get a thick batter:

- 8 3/4 oz sugar (1 1/4 c)
- 1 1/8 oz flour (1/4 c)
- 1 oz unsweetened cocoa powder (1/3 c)
- dash of salt

Slowly whisk in milk to get smooth mixture:

- 1 1/4 c milk

Cook over medium heat until thick and bubbly, whisking constantly.
Cook another 2 minutes, then remove from heat.
Whisk in:

- 1 t vanilla extract

Whisk together:

- 4 reserved egg whites
- 1/4 t cream of tartar
- 9 oz sugar (1 1/4 c)
- pinch of salt

Over a double boiler, cook to 185 F, whisking constantly.
In a stand mixer, whisk on high until meringue reaches full volume.

Put custard into pie crust, top with meringue.  Serve chilled.
