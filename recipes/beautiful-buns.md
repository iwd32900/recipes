Beautiful Burger Buns

An all-purpose tender, slightly sweet yeast dough.
[The version on the King Arthur website](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/beautiful-burger-buns-recipe) differs from the one in their book.
I find the version in the book to produce superior results.

Whisk together:

* 13.75 oz all-purpose flour
* 1.75 oz sugar
* 1 t salt
* 1 T instant yeast

Mix in:

* 8 oz warm water (by weight)
* 2 T butter, at room temperature or sliced thin
* 1 large egg

Knead with dough hook in stand mixer.
Cover and let rise, about 2 hours.
(Warmer water will rise faster, cooler water will rise slower.)

Tangzhong conversion according to the formula on [King Arthur Flour](https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2018/07/23/how-to-convert-a-bread-recipe-to-tangzhong/).

Whisk together:

* 360 g all-purpose flour (store brand)
* 50 g sugar
* 1 t salt
* 1 T instant yeast

Make a slurry by whisking and heating, about 1 minute in the microwave:

* 30 g flour (1/4 c)
* 150 g water

Mix in:

* 100 g warm water
* 2 T butter, at room temperature or sliced thin
* 1 large egg

This gives a dough with ~76% hydration.
