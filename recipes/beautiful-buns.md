# Beautiful Burger Buns

An all-purpose tender, slightly sweet yeast dough.
[The version on the King Arthur website](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/beautiful-burger-buns-recipe) differs from the one in their book.
I find the version in the book to produce superior results.

Whisk together:

* 13.75 oz all-purpose flour
* 1.75 oz sugar
* 1 t salt
* 1 T instant yeast

Mix in:

* 8 oz warm water (by weight)
* 2 T butter, at room temperature or sliced thin
* 1 large egg

Knead with dough hook in stand mixer, about 5 minutes.
Dough will be wet and slack.
Scrape down sides of bowl to consolidate dough.
Cover and let rise, about 1.5 hours.
(Warmer water will rise faster, cooler water will rise slower.)
Shape and bake depending on desired application.

I prefer generic grocery-store all purpose flour for this recipe,
instead of a higher-protein flour like King Arthur.

The dough can be made with only 1 tsp of yeast, but rising times will be double or more.
The larger amount of yeast ensures that the raw egg is at room temperature for a short enough time to avoid any possibility of food poisoning.

For 12 yeast dinner rolls use a 9x13 pan or a 10" round springform pan.
Shape dough into balls and let rise to desired size, about 45-60 minutes.
Bake 12-15 minutes at 375 F.

Optionally, glaze the tops before baking with 1 egg beaten with a pinch of salt.

Procedure is similar for 12 hotdog buns, 8 hamburger buns, or 6 hoagie rolls.
Hotdog buns and hoagie rolls are shaped as *batards* (search YouTube for technique).
Hamburger rolls are flattened balls.

For Texas-style kolaches, divide dough into 24 balls.
Flatten each ball and wrap around one mini cocktail sausage and 1/4 slice of American cheese.
That means you'll need:

* 24 mini cocktail smoked beef sausages, such as Li'l Smokies (10 oz package)
* 6 slices American cheese

Bake for 12 minutes at convection 350 F, or conventional 375 F.

For cinnamon rolls, roll out dough into a large rectangle and spread with:

* 4 T butter, very soft or partially melted
* 1 c (7 oz) brown sugar
* 1 T cinnamon (mixed into the sugar)

Roll up into a log, starting from the long edge.
Slice into 12 rolls and place in a 9x13 pan.
Let rise to desired size, about 45-60 minutes.
Optionally, refrigerate overnight and bake the next day.

For 12 cinnamon rolls in a 9x13 pan, bake 15-18 minutes at convection 350 F, or conventional 375 F.

Make frosting from:

* 5 5/8 oz (1.5 c) powdered sugar
* heavy whipping cream to desired consistency
* pinch of salt
* vanilla extract

Other dairy or citrus juice can be used for the frosting, but cream gives the richest texture.

For King Cake, the log can be coiled into a ring instead of being sliced into rolls.
Set on parchment paper on a cookie sheet.
Alternately, divide dough in thirds and make three thin logs, and braid together before shaping into a ring.
In either case, after frosting, decorate with yellow, green, and purple sugars.

For fried applications (doughnuts!) or for rolls that keep longer,
this recipe can be made with the *tangzhong* technique instead.

I use the tangzhong version if I'm making:
* [Apple fritters](apple-fritters.md)
* [Jelly-filled doughnuts](filled-doughnuts.md)

Whisk together:

* 360 g all-purpose flour (store brand)
* 50 g sugar
* 1 t salt
* 1 T instant yeast

Make a slurry by whisking and heating, about 1 minute in the microwave:

* 30 g flour (1/4 c)
* 150 g water

Mix in:

* 100 g warm water
* 2 T butter, at room temperature or sliced thin
* 1 large egg

This gives a dough with ~76% hydration.

Tangzhong conversion was made according to the formula on [King Arthur Flour](https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2018/07/23/how-to-convert-a-bread-recipe-to-tangzhong).
