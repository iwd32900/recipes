# Ciabatta

Whisk together:

- 15 oz King Arthur all-purpose flour
- 1.5 t table salt
- 0.25 t instant yeast

Stir in until uniformly mixed:

- 1 oz buttermilk
- 0.5 oz vinegar
- 10.5 oz cool water

Cover and let rise at room temperature overnight (8 to 18 hours).
Flour generously and gently move to counter top.
Divide in half.
Fold each half into thirds, like a letter.
Do this three times in total, alternating directions.
Place the shaped dough seam-side down on a half sheet pan covered with greased and floured parchment paper.

Let rise for 30 minutes --
a microwave with a mug or two of boiling water provides a nicely warm, humid proofing box.
Using wet finger tips, dimple the dough to make it wider, longer, and flatter.
Let rise another 60-90 minutes (or more) in the proofing box, until very puffy.

Heat the oven to 450 F.
Mist the dough with water before it goes into the oven,
and again at 2 and 4 minutes into the baking the time.
Bake for about 25 minutes total, until deep golden brown on top.
(Place the sheet pan on an oven rack, because baking stones tend to burn the bottom crust.)

## Notes

- Makes about 27 oz of dough in total, about 1600 total calories.
- Lactic acid (buttermilk) and acetic acid (vinegar) simulate sourdough flavors.
- A little milk or buttermilk helps moderate the size of the holes, so they don't get TOO big.
- This is a very wet dough at 80% hydration, so glutten develops naturally over night without kneading.
  The brief folding/shaping process further strengthens the glutten.
- Dough should be handled gently to preserve the characteristic open hole structure.
  However, dimpling is essential in promoting large, irregular, open holes.
- Greasing and flouring the parchment helps keep the wet dough from sticking excessively during shaping.
- This recipe is a hybrid of the no-knead and ciabatta recipes from Cook's Illustrated,
  with some inspiration from Peter Reinhart as well.
