King Cake

Adapted from [a recipe by John Besh](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/king-cake-356833).

In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine

* 1 c warm milk (100 - 110 F)
* 3.5 oz sugar (1/2 c)
* 1 T instant yeast

When yeast bubbles, whisk in

* 5 egg yolks
* 2 sticks butter, melted (1 c)
* 1 t vanilla extract
* zest of 1 lemon

Using the dough hook, knead in

* 17.5 oz King Arthur all-purpose flour
* 1 t ground cinnamon
* grated nutmeg
* 1 1/4 t salt

Dough should just come together into a ball, and will be soft and greasy.
King Arthur flour helps create more gluten, to give the rich dough a bit more rise.

Cover and rise for 90 minutes, folding the dough over on itself several times every 30 min to aid gluten development.

Divide the dough into three equal pieces, 14 oz each.
Stretch, roll, and pat each one into a long strip 24" x 3".
Down the center of each, spread about 3 T of a mixture of

* 3.5 oz brown sugar (1/2 c)
* 2 t ground cinnamon

Pinch the dough together to make three long tubes.
If omitting filling for a more traditional king cake, roll and pinch the dough into ropes.
Braid the three pieces together.
Transfer braid to a parchment-lined baking sheet and shape into a ring.
If desired, place a greased ramekin in the center to preserve the shape.
Cover and rise for 30 minutes.
While dough rises, preheat oven to 375 F.

Bake dough until lightly browned and interior reaches 190 F, about 24-28 minutes.
Let cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes.

Prepare green, yellow, and purple sugars separately by combining in a mini food processor

* 1.75 oz sugar (1/4 c)
* 2 drops gel food coloring

Make a glaze by combining

* 7.5 oz powdered sugar
* juice of half a lemon
* milk to make a thick glaze, about 2 - 3 T

Drizzle glaze over cooled king cake, then sprinkle colored sugar in alternating bands.
(Future:  consider a buttermilk glaze instead?)
