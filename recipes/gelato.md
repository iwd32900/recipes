Bring to a boil.  Remove from heat.  Whisk in:

- 8 oz non-alcoholic liquid (milk, juice, fruit puree, etc)
- vanilla bean, citrus zest, or other flavorings that need to steep

Optionally, use hot liquid to temper an egg yolk, then simmer 2 more minutes.

Strain, if needed.  Chill completely.  Churn in canister-style ice cream maker, about 20 min.
