A hybrid of the "roti" and "soft wrap bread" recipes in the King Arthur Baker's Companion.
The boiling water weakens the dough but makes it more extensible and easier to roll out.
I use King Arthur All Purpose flour for this recipe.

In a small bowl, whisk together:
- 8 oz flour
- 2 t baking powder
- 1.5 t salt

In a metal mixer bowl, stir together:
- 6 oz flour
- 6 oz boiling water

Once combined, add in:
- 6 oz cool water
- 7/8 oz vegetable oil (2 T)
- flour mixture

Kneed with dough hook until a cohesive dough comes together, adding more flour if necessary.
Divide into 8 balls and cover, rolling out one at time.
Cook in a dry skillet over medium heat, flipping once, until spotty brown on both sides.
