Cranberry Cake

Lightly adapted from https://barefeetinthekitchen.com/cranberry-christmas-cake/

Ingredients

- 3 eggs
- 14 oz (2 cups) sugar
- 1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/4 t salt
- 9.5 oz (2 cups) all-purpose flour
- 12 oz (1 bag) fresh cranberries

Instructions

- Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
- With a mixer, whisk the eggs with the sugar until slightly thickened and light in color, about 5-7 minutes.
  The mixture should almost double in size.
  The eggs work as your leavening agent in this recipe, so do not skip this step.
  This mixture should form a ribbon when you lift the beaters out of the bowl.
- Add the butter, vanilla, and salt; mix two more minutes.
- Add the flour and cranberries and stir to mix.
- Spread in a buttered 9x13 pan.
  Bake at 350 F for 40-45 minutes, or until very lightly browned
  and a toothpick inserted near the center of the cake comes out clean.
