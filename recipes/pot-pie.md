Pennsylvania Dutch Boiled Chicken Pot Pie

Feeds about 6 average adults.  Can be doubled, in a larger pot.

In a ~5 qt pot, place

* 2 very large bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts
* 3 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* salt
* water to cover

Simmer until chicken is cooked through.
Strain broth and return to pot.
De-bone breasts and cut meat into bite-sized pieces.
Reserve thighs for another use;  they're just to make the broth richer.

To make the dough, combine

* 4 c all-purpose flour, such as King Arthur
* 1 stick (4 oz) butter
* 1 tsp salt

Cut the butter into the flour until the butter is in pea-sized pieces.
With a fork, mix in

* 2 eggs, beaten, with water added to make 1 cup total volume

Knead the dough until it comes together.
Wrap in plastic and rest in the refrigerator for ~30 minutes.

To the pot of broth, add

* 1 russet potato, peeled and cubed

Return the broth to a boil.
Working in 4-5 batches, remove a portion of dough and roll out as thin as possible on a floured counter.
The dough should be thin enough to see through faintly.
Cut the dough into 2-inch squares using a knife or pizza wheel.
Add the noodles to the boiling pot one at a time.
After each batch, add a few grinds of fresh pepper, and stir.
As noodles are added, the pot pie will get thicker.
New noodles should be added where broth is bubbling up between the other noodles.
Watch for noodles sticking to the bottom of the pot.
The pot pie should end up as a thick stew.
If it gets too thick, thin it with additional water or chicken broth.

Simmer for about 20 min after adding the last noodles.
Traditional accompaniments are cole slaw and dill pickles.
